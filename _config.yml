      I'm a researcher and engineer passionate about human-machine interaction, UX strategy, and human-centered design. My work bridges data, design, and strategy to 
      create seamless, intuitive, and trust-enhancing user experiences.<br><br>

      I'm currently pursusing my Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering (Human Factors) at University of Massachusetts Amherst, and working as a Rsearch Assitant at Human performance 
      lab with Dr. Shannon C. Roberts, where I focus on understanding trust and perceptions of autonomous vehicles.<br><br>

  In Summer 2024, I worked as a UX Research Intern at TORC Robotics, leading stakeholder research, uncovering transparency gaps, and optimizing UX workflows for AV 
  development. My work led to five key process improvements, streamlining operations and enhancing UX strategy. <br><br>
      
  In Fall 2022, I worked as a Quantitative Human-Computer Interaction Research Intern at Motional, conducting mixed-methods research, leveraging Python and R to analyze 
  user cognition and optimize KPIs for AV usability and trust.<br><br>
      
  From 2020 to 2021, I worked as a Research Engineer Co-op at Ahold Delhaize USA, conducting qualitative research with grocery store stakeholders to identify pain 
  points in automation adoption. <br><br>
      
  Prior to my PhD, I researched shared autonomy and adaptive human-machine systems under Dr. Jamison Heard at Rochester Institute of Technology, developing 
  fuzzy-logic-based controllers for workload-adaptive automation. <br><br> 
      
  I have contributed to human-centered design in automation across academia and industry, focusing on trust, transparency, and usability in intelligent systems.
